  "description" : "This is my first released mod, so it may have issues.\n\nYour arsenal will broaden so much you won't be able to carry it all at once.\n\nBehold, Weapons Addition! This mod adds a huge amount of weapons to the game. Some of them can come easy, but others require some huge grinding.\n\n[h1]Start with a tier 3 Inventor's Table (Architect's Table) and craft an Experimental Weapons Station.[/h1] In order to craft anything at this station, you need to use a few Expeimental Weapons Blueprints, which teach you recipes for most weapons added with this mod. Once you use a few of those, some materials you may commonly find in space, often distinguishable with a prefix of High-Tech or similar, will be put to good use.\n\nSome weapons and items you may not be able to find at all. [b]But that's because they are so overpowered at some times that they need to be extremely hard to get.[/b] Once you get a few blueprints for the  Experimental Weapons Station, take them to a Conversion Machine, where you will find the ability to craft blueprints for high-end items and weapons. Of course, for the right price...\n\nBut in order to get a superior sword, look on garden planets for an ancient structure with some red lights. The chest contains a terrible shortsword, which is used as a material for the real sword. Then look on tier 5+ planets for ancient structures with a huge amount of pots and traps. These contain the materials necessary for crafting the sword.\n\n[b]Suggestions are welcome![/b]\n\nNon-Steam version: http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/particle-accelerator-addition.4787/\n\n[h1][u]CHANGELOG;[/u][/h1][list]\n[*]Found here! https://pastebin.com/KSrsNmth.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Questions?
