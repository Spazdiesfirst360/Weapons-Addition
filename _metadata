  "description" : "This is my first released mod, so it may have issues.\n\nYour arsenal will broaden so much you won't be able to carry it all at once.\n\nBehold, Weapons Addition! This mod adds a huge amount of weapons to the game. Some of them can come easy, but others require some huge grinding.\n\n[h1]Start with a tier 3 Inventor's Table (Architect's Table) and craft an Experimental Weapons Station.[/h1] Here, you may find the ability to craft... nothing! But that's because the blueprints are earned via tenants. Once you use a few of those, some materials you may commonly find in space, often distinguishable with a prefix of High-Tech or similar, will be put to good use.\n\nSome weapons and items you may not be able to find at all. [b]But that's because they are so overpowered at some times that they need to be extremely hard to get.[/b] Once you get a few blueprints for the  Experimental Weapons Station, take them to a Conversion Machine, where you will find the ability to craft blueprints for high-end items and weapons. Of course, for the right price...\n\nBut in order to get a superior sword, look on garden planets for an ancient structure with some red lights. The chest contains a terrible shortsword, which is used as a material for the real sword. Then look on tier 5+ planets for ancient structures with a huge amount of pots and traps. These contain the materials necessary for crafting the sword.\n\n[h1]If your looking for a mod called Particle Accelerator Addition or Particle Accelerator Addon, this is that mod, but the PAA content to Weapons Addition content tipped enormously in Weapons Addition's favor, so I renamed it.[/h1]\n\nPAA details:\nAdds overpowered material deconstruction abilities. Create elements out of deconstructed elements! Stock up on materials, or turn all that copper into titanium for that cool mech component.\n\n[h1][u]Features;[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Crossover items from Terraria (the original mod is broken as far as I know). [b][u][I do not own the sprites or functionality ideas. As far as I know, this may fall under fair use copyright law][/u][/b].\n[*]Custom sound (yes, the Particle Accelerator has it's own crafting sound).\n[*]custom sprites.\n[*]Over 70 new recipes and over 20 new different items.\n[*][b]Start by crafting the Particle Accelerator with the inventor's table. After you craft Protons, put them in the refinery to get Electrons (it was the only thing that made *some* sense and would work).[/b]\n[*]Added stims are found in the same way as vanilla stims.\n[/list]\n[list]\n[*][b]Suggestions are welcome![/b]\n[/list]\n[h1][u]Mods Merged Into Particle Accelerator Addon;[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Status Guns: Make guns that inflict status effects on npcs and players. Heal your team! or make an enemy glow so you can track them in the dark.\n[*]Perfect Stuff: More Perfect stuff. Furniture, etc.\n[/list]\n\nNon-Steam version: http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/particle-accelerator-addition.4787/\n\n[h1][u]CHANGELOG;[/u][/h1][list]\n[*]Found here! https://pastebin.com/KSrsNmth.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Questions?

Take them to Suggestions thread!\n[/h1]\n[b][u][Note]: Please do not post spam in any thread or in the comments section. Spam will be deleted on sight![/u][/b]",
