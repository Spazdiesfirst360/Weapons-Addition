  "description" : "This is my first released mod, so it may have issues.\n\nOpen up your endgame arsenal!\n\nBehold, Weapons Addition! This mod adds a huge amount of weapons to the game. Some of them can come easy, but others require some huge grinding.\n\n[h1]Start with a tier 3 Inventor's Table (Architect's Table) and craft an Experimental Weapons Station.[/h1] In order to craft anything at this station, you need to use a few Expeimental Weapons Blueprints, which teach you recipes for most weapons added with this mod. Once you use a few of those, some materials you may commonly find in space, often distinguishable with a prefix of High-Tech or similar, will be put to good use.\n\nSome weapons and items you may not be able to find at all. Once you get a few blueprints for the Experimental Weapons Station, take them to a Conversion Machine, where you will find the ability to craft blueprints for high-end items and weapons. Of course, for the right price...\n\nIn order to get an upgraded version of the protectorate sword, start by looking in the ship locker; it contains a terrible shortsword, which is used as a material for the real sword. Then delve through ancient vaults to find the resources to upgrade the sword. Opening essence chests may yield the materials necessary for the upgrade.\n\n[b]Suggestions for mod content are welcome![/b]\n\nNon-Steam version: http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/particle-accelerator-addition.4787/\n\n[h1][u]CHANGELOG;[/u][/h1][list]\n[*]Found here! https://pastebin.com/KSrsNmth.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Questions?
