		"Hello, and thanks for subscribing/downloading this mod
I am sure you may find this mod useful for whatever reason. Whether it be the Weapons Addition portion of this mod, or all of it in general, you will certainly have fun plaing around with the many items added in this mod.

		"^green;The Particle Accelerator^reset;
Useful for deconstructing elements, the Particle Accelerator is crafted at the Engineer's Table (tier 2 Inventor's Table). It is here that you will discover some elements such as Cobalt, Palladium, and Technetium.",
		"But before you get started, craft a Neutron by pressing 'C' and looking for 'Neutron'. It only costs 1 pixel so you can learn the recipes early. The popups will say, 'Learned to Craft: Perfectly Generic Item', but the recipes should work fine.",
		"^green;The Liquids Station^reset;
The Liquids Station is used th craft liquids and gases added by this mod. You will need Liquid Base and Gas Base, found as valuable treasure, to unlock the recipes this station is used for. Crafted at Engineer's Table.",
		"^red;The Experimental Weapons Station^reset;
This station is used to craft many weapons added in the Weapons Addition portion of this mod. You will need Experimental Weapon Blueprints to unlock recipes that this station is used for. Crafted at Architect's Table.",
		"green;Blueprints: Where are They?reset;
Object Blueprints, which unlock recipes for objects added by this mod, are found as valuable treasure. Experimental Weapon Blueprints are recieved as tenant gifts from villager and mechant tenant treasure pools.",
		"Weapon Blueprints are also recieved as tenant gifts the same way, but are a crafting material used for recipes at the Experimental Weapons Station.",
		"^green;Protons and Electrons^reset;
Protons are obtained by crafting them in the Particle Accelerator at the cost of elements such as titanium. Electrons are obtained by putting protons in the refinery at a rate of 1:1.",
		"^green;Quarks^reset;
Quarks are currently just an idea, but quarks would be used to make protons. And instead of crafting protons directly, elements would turn into quarks, creating an extra step in the crafting process.",
		"^green;Other Materials^reset;
Other materials used to craft weapons at the Experimental Weapons Station are found in space, or wherever the salvage loot pool is involved. But mostly in space. Better start grinding.",
		"^green;Broken Stuff: What Doesn't Work^reset;
Some objects have issues with their default.off frame (somehow), and one object will be invisible, and the Lunar Laser Mech Arm is having issues. But other than that, the mod should be fine.",
